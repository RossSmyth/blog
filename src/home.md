# Me

I am an embedded developer who works at a company that makes motor drives. I spend about 60%-70% of my time in C, 25% of my time in Rust, and the rest in Nix these days.

Things I like:

- Compilers
- Language design
- Coffee
- Rust
- Bouldering
- Space systems
- User experience

# My Blog

I made this so it would be easier for me to write about things I am thinking about. Whether I actually use it or not we shall see.
